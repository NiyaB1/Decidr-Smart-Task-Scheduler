# Decision Fatigue Reducer

A minimalist web application designed to eliminate decision fatigue by forcing a single, actionable decision instead of overwhelming you with choices.

## 🧠 The Problem

Modern life is plagued by constant micro-decisions:
- "What should I eat for lunch?"
- "When should I start working?"
- "Which task should I tackle first?"
- "How long should I break for?"

Each small decision depletes your cognitive resources, leading to **decision fatigue**—the deterioration of decision quality after making many choices. By evening, you're paralyzed and exhausted.

## ✨ The Solution

Decision Fatigue Reducer cuts through the noise with a brutally simple approach:

1. **Answer 3 quick constraints** about your situation
2. **Get 1 decision** (no lists, no options, no debate)
3. **Execute immediately**

No productivity theater. No choice paralysis. Just clarity.

Example usage:
```
Q: What category? → Work
Q: How much time? → 20 minutes
Q: Your energy level? → Medium

You decided:
→ Finish one small task in 20 minutes
```

## 🎯 Why This Works

- **Reduces cognitive load** — Decision fatigue happens when you choose. One decision = instant clarity
- **Psychological insight** — Constraints breed creativity; unlimited options breed anxiety
- **Friction-free** — Minimal interface, maximum impact
- **Honest** — Doesn't pretend to be a productivity system; it's a decision tool

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
